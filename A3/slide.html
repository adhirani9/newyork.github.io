              New York City, officially named the City of New York, is at the
              center of international finance, politics, entertainment, and
              culture, and is one of the world's major global cities with a
              virtually unrivaled collection of museums, galleries, performance
              venues, media outlets, international corporations, and stock
              exchanges. The city is also home to the United Nations, along with
              all of the international missions associated with it.

            New York City has one of the most famous skylines in the world;
            because of both its high residential density and the extremely high
            real estate values found in the city's central business districts,
            New York has amassed the largest collection of office and
            residential towers in the world. In fact, New York actually has
            three separately recognizable skylines: Midtown Manhattan, Downtown
            Manhattan, and Downtown Brooklyn.

            New York City is governed by the New York City Charter. The charter
            is enacted and amended by the New York State Legislature, and
            occasionally through referendum. Though subservient to the state of
            New York, the city enjoys a high degree of legislative and executive
            autonomy. Like most governmental entities in the United States, the
            city government is divided into executive, legislative and judicial
            branches.

            New York City, sometimes called "The City That Never Sleeps," is
            famously fast-paced and active, and the American idiom "in a New
            York minute" means "immediately." New York City residents are called
            "New Yorkers". Residents of the metropolitan area generally refer to
            New York City as "The City" and the acronym "NYC", as opposed to
            just "NY", helps to avoid confusing references to the state of New
            York. The nickname most used for New York City is the "Big Apple."
